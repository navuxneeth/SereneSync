## üîå Connect to Real ESP32

### Configure ESP32 URL

1. Ensure your phone/computer is on the same network as ESP32
2. Find your ESP32's IP address (default: 192.168.4.1 if using AP mode)
3. Open SereneSync ‚Üí Settings
4. Enter ESP32 URL: `http://192.168.4.x`
5. Tap "Test" to verify connection
6. Tap "Save" to store configuration

### Sync with ESP32

After configuration:
1. Pull down on Home Screen to refresh
2. Or go to Settings ‚Üí "Sync with ESP32"

## üß™ Testing Features

### Test Device Control
1. Go to Living Room
2. Toggle "Ceiling Light" - watch the switch animate
3. Adjust the slider - see percentage update
4. Toggle back off - slider disappears

### Test Room Control
1. Open any room
2. Turn individual devices on
3. Tap "Turn All Off" - all devices switch off together

### Test Settings
1. Go to Settings
2. Try different ESP32 URLs
3. Test connection (will fail without real ESP32, but UI works)

## üé® Customization

### Add Your Own Rooms

Edit `lib/services/data_service.dart`:

```dart
_rooms = [
  Room(id: '5', name: 'Your Room', icon: 'üè†'),
  // Add more rooms...
];
```

### Add Your Own Devices

```dart
_devices = [
  Device(
    id: 'your_device_id',
    name: 'Your Device',
    type: ApplianceType.light,
    roomId: '5', // Match room ID
    isOn: false,
    intensity: 50,
  ),
];
```

### Change Theme Colors

Edit `lib/main.dart`:

```dart
theme: ThemeData(
  colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(
    seedColor: Colors.purple, // Change color here
    brightness: Brightness.light,
  ),
  // ...
)
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Flutter not found"
```bash
# Add Flutter to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
```

### "No devices found"
```bash
# Check connected devices
flutter devices

# For Android emulator
emulator -avd Pixel_6_API_33

# For iOS simulator
open -a Simulator
```

### "Pub get failed"
```bash
# Clear cache and retry
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### "Build failed"
```bash
# Clean build
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### ESP32 Connection Issues

**Cannot connect to ESP32:**
- Verify ESP32 is powered on
- Check Wi-Fi connection (same network)
- Verify IP address is correct
- Try pinging: `ping 192.168.4.1`
- Check ESP32 firmware is running web server

**Connection timeout:**
- ESP32 might be slow to respond
- Check ESP32 serial monitor for errors
- Verify firewall settings
- Try from different device

## üìö Next Steps

### For Users
- Read the [README.md](README.md) for full feature list
- Check [ESP32_API_SPEC.md](ESP32_API_SPEC.md) for hardware setup
- Explore the Settings screen for configuration options

### For Developers
- Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand code structure
- Check `test/widget_test.dart` for testing examples
- Explore the codebase starting from `lib/main.dart`

### For ESP32 Setup
- See [ESP32_API_SPEC.md](ESP32_API_SPEC.md) for required endpoints
- Implement the REST API on your ESP32
- Test each endpoint with curl/Postman first

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Hot Reload**: Press `r` in terminal while app is running to instantly see changes
2. **Use Hot Restart**: Press `R` for full restart
3. **Debug with Chrome**: Best for UI development and debugging
4. **Check Console**: Watch for ESP32 connection logs
5. **Sample Data**: Useful for development without hardware

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Demo Without Hardware
- Just run the app - sample data included
- All UI features work without ESP32
- Perfect for showcasing the interface

### Scenario 2: Development with Mock Server
- Use Postman or similar to create mock API
- Point app to mock server URL
- Test without physical devices

### Scenario 3: Production with Real ESP32
- Flash ESP32 with proper firmware
- Configure network settings
- Update app with ESP32's IP
- Full control of real devices!
