This is a placeholder for the Room Details screenshot.
The actual screenshot would show:
- Back button and room name in app bar
- List of device control cards
- Each device shows name, icon, toggle switch
- Active devices show intensity sliders
- Percentage indicators for brightness/speed
- "Turn All On/Off" button at bottom
- Smooth animations and Material Design styling
