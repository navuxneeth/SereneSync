## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

**When filing a bug report, include:**

- A clear, descriptive title
- Exact steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Flutter version: `flutter --version`
- Device/emulator details
- ESP32 firmware version (if applicable)

**Example Bug Report:**

```markdown
**Title**: Device toggle switch doesn't update after turning on

**Steps to reproduce**:
1. Open Living Room
2. Toggle Ceiling Light on
3. Observe switch state

**Expected**: Switch shows ON state
**Actual**: Switch remains in OFF state

**Environment**:
- Flutter 3.10.5
- Android 13, Pixel 6
- ESP32 firmware v1.0.0
```

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues.

**Include in your suggestion:**

- Clear title and description
- Use case and motivation
- Expected behavior
- Mockups or examples (if applicable)
- Potential implementation approach

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to start? Look for issues labeled:

- `good first issue` - Suitable for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Need community input
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements

### Pull Requests

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our [Style Guidelines](#style-guidelines)

3. Test your changes:
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   flutter test
   flutter run
   ```

4. Commit with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

5. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. Open a Pull Request on GitHub

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Stable production code
- `feature/*` - New features
- `fix/*` - Bug fixes
- `docs/*` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/*` - Code refactoring

### Testing

Before submitting, ensure:

1. **Unit Tests Pass**:
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

2. **Code Analysis Passes**:
   ```bash
   flutter analyze
   ```

3. **App Runs Successfully**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test affected features
   - Test on multiple screen sizes
   - Verify no regressions

### Adding New Features

When adding a feature:

1. **Update Documentation**:
   - Add to README.md if user-facing
   - Update ARCHITECTURE.md if architectural
   - Add code comments for complex logic

2. **Write Tests**:
   - Unit tests for models and services
   - Widget tests for UI components

3. **Consider Extensibility**:
   - Will this work with future features?
   - Is it maintainable?
   - Does it follow existing patterns?

## Style Guidelines

### Dart Code Style

Follow the [Official Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).

**Key Points**:

- Use `dart format` before committing
- Maximum line length: 80 characters
- Use `const` constructors where possible
- Prefer `final` over `var` when type is known
- Use trailing commas for better formatting

**Example**:

```dart
class Device {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final ApplianceType type;
  
  const Device({
    required this.id,
    required this.name,
    required this.type,
  });
}
```

### File Organization

```dart
// 1. Imports - Dart SDK first
import 'dart:async';

// 2. Flutter packages
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

// 3. Third-party packages
import 'package:provider/provider.dart';

// 4. Local imports
import '../models/device.dart';
import '../services/data_service.dart';
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `DeviceControl`)
- **Files**: `snake_case` (e.g., `device_control.dart`)
- **Variables**: `camelCase` (e.g., `deviceId`)
- **Constants**: `camelCase` with `const` (e.g., `const maxDevices`)
- **Private**: Prefix with `_` (e.g., `_privateMethod`)

### Comments

- Use comments sparingly - code should be self-documenting
- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Use `///` for public API documentation
- Use `//` for inline comments

```dart
/// Toggles the device state and notifies listeners.
/// 
/// Returns true if the operation succeeded, false otherwise.
Future<bool> toggleDevice(Device device) async {
  // Update local state optimistically for better UX
  device.isOn = !device.isOn;
  notifyListeners();
  
  // Send command to ESP32
  return await _esp32Service.toggle(device.id, device.isOn);
}
```

### Widget Guidelines

- Keep widgets small and focused
- Extract reusable components
- Use `const` constructors for static widgets
- Prefer composition over inheritance

```dart
// Good: Small, focused widget
class DeviceCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final Device device;
  
  const DeviceCard({super.key, required this.device});
  
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: ListTile(
        title: Text(device.name),
        trailing: Switch(
          value: device.isOn,
          onChanged: (_) => _toggleDevice(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
